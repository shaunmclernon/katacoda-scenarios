In this scenario we will stand up an instance of Jenkins Evergreen and build a sample pipeline.

The scenario is designed to demostrate how you can use pipelines within a Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD) workflow to download software code from GitHub, perform unit tests and display a historical test result report.

In essence we are automating the steps that are documented on the [Evergreen](https://jenkins.io/projects/evergreen/) page.

Weave Scope lets you monitor and control your containerized microservices applications. By providing a visual map of your Docker Containers, you can see the dependencies and communication links between them.

Scope automatically detects processes, containers, hosts. No kernel modules, no agents, no special libraries, no coding.

This scenario explains how to map and visualise connections your Docker containers running on a Kubernetes cluster.

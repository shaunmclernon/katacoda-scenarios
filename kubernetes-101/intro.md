In this hands-on scenario, you will learn the basic concepts of Kubernetes.

- Interact with Kubernetes through using the command line tool `kubectl`
- Create a single master node with `kubeadm`
- Create a worker node and join the cluster
- Install a Kubernetes dashboard
- Deploy the sample applications [Dockercoins](https://github.com/dockersamples/dockercoins)

### Note

To speed things up, this scenario will start with two Ubuntu machines provisioned and `kubeadm` and `kubectl` have already installed. References links have been provided at the bottom of each section to provide further details.
